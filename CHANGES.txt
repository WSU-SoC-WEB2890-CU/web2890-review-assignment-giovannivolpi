TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1. Change the home page video with portrait of myself. I want people to know who I am and what this website is about.
2. Used boostrap to edit the image width for the portrait. 
3. Used an "a" link for the "Get in Touch" button to make it scroll all the way down to the contact me section of the portfolio.
   I did this to add more interaction with the website, and since we are working with one page only, it would make it more entertaining to add this feature.
4. Added "my jounrey" to give more empahsis about how I strive in success and what keeps me going!
5. Under "web development" I emphasize about my freelance career and to adverstise it more to users who will view my page. 
6. Under "testimonials", I switched to "reviews" from people who I have work with or were clients to, again, emphiszes more my freelaning carrer as a UI/UX developer. 
7. Under FAQ, I thought it would be interesting to give more basic questions about how I make websites and generic questions clients ask me. 
8. At the bottom of the page, I change the user input into "contact me" in case users were curious as of any work they need help with or want to connect.  
9. Added a get back to the top button to help users get up there without scrolling
10. made the links to the UI/UX section clickable so users can see the websites created
